The goal of this website is to implement a proof of concept program that simulates the sharing of data to a community of users using a virtual currency. In summary the user is designed to have a wallet, that holds their virtual balance and can have multiple files that can be downloaded by other users. Once a user purchases a file using their credit, the credit will be subtracted from the purchaser's balance and will be transferred to the owner of the file. The owner can then use that credit in addition to their original credit to download other users' files.</p>
