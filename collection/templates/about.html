	<p>
The goal of this website is to implement a proof of concept program that simulates 
the sharing of data to a community of users using a virtual currency. 
In summary the user is designed to have a wallet, that holds their virtual 
balance and can have multiple files that can be
downloaded by other users (work in progress.)</p>
